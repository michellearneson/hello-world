# hello-world
this is an exemplar of a short description.


I am graduating with a degree in cognitive science at the end of this quarter, early winter of 2022. Dancing, tea tasting, music, and seeing new landscapes all make me feel alive. Although I am new to GitHub and data science in general, I feel optimistic about this course, my team, and our project.
